## Authentication Middleware

Implementation of several middleware functions for authentication. Includes functions for validating access tokens from URL query params, adding common CORS headers to a server, validating an API key found in a request header, and getting a user from login credentials passed in the body of a request\*.

This project is built in TypeScript.

### Use Locally

If you want to use any of these functions in your own project, fork and clone this repo to your local machine and `npm install`.

\*This is just a simple example of authentication logic and is not secure.
